This is a material for the Medium post: https://medium.com/@mikolaj.buchwald/yolo-and-coco-object-recognition-basics-in-python-65d06f42a6f8

This tutorial is an adaptation of [the example](https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html) explained in the official OpenCV YOLO documentation. The reason for creating this Notebook is that I myself had difficulties recreating this example based on the aforementioned documentation. That is why I created this step-by-step Notebook when you can re-run all cells and get to know YOLO and coco better.
