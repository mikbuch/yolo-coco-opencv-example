# YOLO and COCO object recognition basics in Python

By [Mikolaj Buchwald (LI profile)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolaj-buchwald/) -- [mikbuch's GitHub](github.com/mikbuch)

This tutorial is an adaptation of [the example](https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html) explained in the official OpenCV YOLO documentation. The reason for creating this Notebook is that I myself had difficulties recreating this example based on the aforementioned documentation. That is why I created this step-by-step Notebook when you can re-run all cells and get to know YOLO and coco better.
