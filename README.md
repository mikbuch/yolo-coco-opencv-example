# YOLO and COCO object recognition basics in Python

This repository contains the materials that are explained in [my post at Medium](https://medium.com/@mikolaj.buchwald/yolo-and-coco-object-recognition-basics-in-python-65d06f42a6f8). The information about the author (Mikolaj Buchwald) can be found at [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikolaj-buchwald/), see also my [GitHub profile (mikbuch)](https://github.com/mikbuch).

This tutorial is an adaptation of [the example](https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html), where OpenCV YOLO and COCO usage is explained. The reason for creating this Notebook is that I myself had difficulties recreating this example based on the aforementioned documentation. That is why I created this step-by-step Notebook where you can easily re-run all cells and get more familiar with YOLO and COCO.
